Manny moves
===========

Subway obstacles
================

We drew Manny.
We moved Manny.

Drawing obstacles and moving obstacles should very similar and therefor easy.
The differences are:
* The obstacle image is different.
* Obstacles move from right to left and not up down.
* The obstacles need to move without our control - even if we don't touch the keyboard.
