Getting started
===============

What is a computer game?
A computer game is a computer program that allows YOU to play.

What is a computer program?
A computer program is a list of commands (also called instructions) to the computer.
The commands are written in a language that the computer can understand.
Our game will be written in a language called Python.

The commands are written in one or more documents.
Each document is also called a file.
Files are organized in the computer in directories (or folders).
Each directory is a folder that contains files

In the figure below we see an example of a directory structure.
The directory structure is like a tree.
The start of the tree (called a root) is the computers hard drive usually called "c:".
You can see in the picture that the root directory has three sub directories (or folders): Home, Program Files and Windows.
The Home directory has one sub directory: thesubwayrat
The thesubwayrat directory has TBD files.



Setting up an editor and a compiler
-----------------------------------
We usually use Microsoft Word to write letters and other documents.
Programs are written in an editor dedicated for writing programs.
We will use Microsoft code.
To install it on your computer click here https://code.visualstudio.com/download and follow the install instructions.

Once we've written a program we need to run (or execute) it.
This is done using a compiler.


- click the extensions button
-write "python" in the top left bar where it says "search Extensions in Marketplace"
- Install the "Python" extension if it is not already installed

- Install python

- TBD

- Connect VSCode to Python
- Press Ctrl+Shift+P 
- type ">python: select interpreter" and select one of the interpreters listed.

- To run a program right click at any point in the document and select "Run Python File in terminal"

Select one or more lines, then press Shift+Enter or right-click and select Run Selection/Line in Python Terminal. This command is convenient for testing just a part of a file.

We will use this option to run simple lines of code
